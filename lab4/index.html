// Rock-paper-scissors (best two out of three)

// October 16 2024
//Print the explanation of the “best two out of thee” rule.
//Set “wins” counters to both the player and the computer
  //Print choices (rock, paper, and scissors) 
		//Validate the choice of the player
	  //Store the choice of the player
	//Randomize a choice for the computer (the possibilities should all be 1/3)
	//Counting down from 3 and publish the answers
  //Test the results and decide the winner, print “draw” if draw.
	//Add 1 to the winner’s “wins” counter if there is a winner
//If the counter of one of them reach 3 (3 wins), print “the winner of this game is” and the winner’s name (user or computer)
//If there is still no winner, repeat the previous steps

					<p>Pseudocode an everyday task</p>
					<pre><code>	
//How to change a tire. 
//First, make sure you are in a safe area away from any oncoming traffic.  
//Walk around the car to see which tire is flat. Find the flat tire.
  //Once located, open car trunk and find replacement tire, jack, and tool kit.
    //Go to the damaged tire and locate adequate jacking points, placing the spare wheel to the side 
	for future use.
      //Place the jack under the car vertically with the feet facing the bottom and the support 
	  facing up.
      //Loose the lugnuts counterclockwise on the tires with the provided wrench in the tool kit. 
      //Crank the jack until the tire is raised 2 inches off of the ground. 
      //Loosen all of the lugnuts and remove them, saving them in a safe place. 
      //Remove the wheel, slide it off of the bolt-threaded studs and place it in the trunk of 
	  the car. 
      //Now grab the spare tire and align the bolt’s threaded studs with the boltholes on 
	  the wheel.
      //Once aligned, place lugnuts on the bolt threads and tighten in a star pattern placing 
	  each lug nut 
	  on the thread and tightening clockwise with the tire wrench.
      //Tighten lug nuts as tight as possible. 
      //On the jack, there should be a small knob that you can twist to release pressure 
	  from the jack.
      //Remove jack.
    //Twist this knob counterclockwise slowly to lower the car onto the replacement tire. 
//Done! You’re ready to drive.
