//How to change a tire. 
//First, make sure you are in a safe area away from any oncoming traffic.  
//Walk around the car to see which tire is flat. Find the flat tire.
  //Once located, open car trunk and find replacement tire, jack, and tool kit.
    //Go to the damaged tire and locate adequate jacking points, placing the spare wheel to the side for future use.
      //Place the jack under the car vertically with the feet facing the bottom and the support facing up.
      //Loose the lugnuts counterclockwise on the tires with the provided wrench in the tool kit. 
      //Crank the jack until the tire is raised 2 inches off of the ground. 
      //Loosen all of the lugnuts and remove them, saving them in a safe place. 
      //Remove the wheel, slide it off of the bolt-threaded studs and place it in the trunk of the car. 
      //Now grab the spare tire and align the bolt’s threaded studs with the boltholes on the wheel.
      //Once aligned, place lugnuts on the bolt threads and tighten in a star pattern placing each lug nut on the thread and tightening clockwise with the tire wrench.
      //Tighten lug nuts as tight as possible. 
      //On the jack, there should be a small knob that you can twist to release pressure from the jack.
      //Remove jack.
    //Twist this knob counterclockwise slowly to lower the car onto the replacement tire. 
//Done! You’re ready to drive.
